# DobieStation
A young PS2 emulator with plans for an optimized Android port, as well as a fast, accurate, and easy-to-use PC port. Basic homebrew is capable of running, but nothing else yet. Not intended for general use.

## Compiling
DobieStation uses Qt 5 and currently only supports qmake and cmake. 

### Building with qmake
```
cd DobieStation/DobieStation
qmake DobieStation.pro
make
```

## Using the Emulator
DobieStation requires a copy of the PS2 BIOS, which must be dumped from your PS2, and can only be run from the command line. Loading files from the GUI will be supported in the near future.

DobieStation takes two arguments from the command line: the name of the BIOS file, and the name of an ELF file.
